### **Simona Final Project [Beta version]**

- **Our story:**

Behind the screen a seed was thrown,

As time passed, the seed of our minds pulled started to grow individually by each character,
and with each next meeting a specific number arose to gather. Number 10 was our shade under
the tree we planted together.

The breakout rooms of Zoom were the ones that would always promt us to play- Time was at
our disposal. Gathering the room number 10 was our safe haven, our social place and the
screen became less lonely. We always knew we wanted to work together in our final gathering.

A song,
A place,
And our laughter, made an idea which once again streched the fruits of our labor and became
Simona.

We will miss our times, but the tree we planted will always remain,
Here, in the space of bits and bytes.
